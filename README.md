# Python-APIs

Utilize Pyton API tool to answer the ask "what's the weather like as we approach the equator?" and drow colcusion. Python script and the OpenWeatherMap API are used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
The end objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: 

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The notebook includes:


* Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.

### Final Observations
Three observable trends

* 1 - The temperature gets higher when we approach the equator
* 2 - There is no relationship between distance from equator and humidity
* 3 - There is no relationship between distance from equator and cloudiness
